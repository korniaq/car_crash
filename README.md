Car crash simulation. Project aimed at expanding numerical methods knowlegde and practising C++. The solver uses Finite Element Method and Conjugate Gradient to solve partial differential equations, implicit method to integrate in time and sparse matrix to store the data. In order to visualise result, which can be seen in simulation.mkv file, a simple winbgi2.h library was used.
